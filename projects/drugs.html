                    <p>This report was a group research effort for a Machine Learning course at UNC. We were able to form a random forest classification model with an <b>accuracy >90% and AUC>0.95</b>. From this we were able to conclude that marijuana use does not seem to lead to all more dangerous drug use, but instead is highly associated with <b>other hallucinogenic and stimulant</b> use.</p>
                    <p>The team found the dataset, cleaned the data, and formed the hypotheses and conclusions together. My personal contributions were the Random Forest model and the Results sections. All other text and graphics were by other members of the group.</p>
