        <p>This project uses JavaScript to visualize a network of my group of friends at UNC Chapel Hill.</p>
        <p>My roommate, Diana, and I thought it would be interesting to look at how connected our friend circles are since we kept finding out that our friends knew each other.</p>
        <p>The site is hosted <a href="https://samantho.github.io/friendChart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and the GitHub repo is <a href="https://github.com/samantho/friendChart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
