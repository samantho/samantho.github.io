        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Black goes first</li>
            <li>On your turn, place one disk on the gameboard</li>
            <li>Available places you may place your disk will highlight in yellow when hovered over</li>
            <li>Any of the opponents disks that are between the one you place and the next of your color will flip to your color</li>
            <li>After one player places a tile, it is the next player's turn</li>
            <li>Once all tiles have disks on them, the game is over</li>
            <li>Whichever player has the most tiles on the board at the end of the game wins</li>
